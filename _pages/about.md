I am broadly interested in continual open-ended learning for self-improving foundation models. My long-term goal is to create AI systems capable of generating their own intrinsic and novel goals and autonomously learn the skills needed to achieve them. I aim to pursue this goal through research in reinforcement learning, meta-learning, intrinsic motivation and continual learning.

I recently graduated with a Master's in Statistics from the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität in Munich. During my Master's I spent two years working as a graduate research assistant at the Chair of Statistical Learning and Data Science and the Chair of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I also spent a year working as a research intern at the FLOWERS Lab at INRIA Bordeaux under the supervision of Dr. Clèment Moulin-Frier working on the emergence of collective open-ended cooperative behaviors. I am currently looking for PhD positions aligned with my research interests. If you have any questions regarding my background or research, feel free to reach out!
